Hi there! I have been playing Spore for about 12 years now (since 2011), and I've started modding it since 2019. My focus is primarily on making QoL improvements and other mods for the Galactic Adventures portion of the game, especially adventures themselves. Some of the mods I've made include [Always 100 Adventure Points](https://github.com/Liskomato/Spore-Always100AdventurePoints), [Neutral Win Animations](https://github.com/Liskomato/Spore-NeutralWinAnimations) and [Adventure Slot Page Expander](https://github.com/Liskomato/Spore-AdventureSlotPageExpander), and more recently [Captain Voice Diversity](https://github.com/Liskomato/Spore-CaptainVoiceDiversity) and [Share-Safe Music](https://github.com/Liskomato/Spore-ShareSafeMusic) (in collaboration with [0KepOnline](https://github.com/0KepOnline)).
